# Goal

We'd like to be able to **generate new OeX Platform plugins easily**.

## Why?

> Why just not to use ["official" plugins cookiecutter][edunext-cookiecutter] or its [RG's fork][rg-cookiecutter]?

- At this time we'd like to use in our customizations a progressive frontend app(s) - not just Django/Mako templates, but a [React]/[Redux] application (or a couple of such applications per plugin).
- React application itself is a separate codebase project.
- We'd like to keep the Plugin codebase and its Frontend(s) codebase(s) closely to each other and [Nx] manages such *monorepos* easily.

## What must be resolved

### New plugin initialization

> "Classic" plugin - the one that is generated by the Cookiecutter (a pluggable OeX Platform app with a classic template-based frontend).

There must be a way easily generate a "classic" OeX Platform plugin's code (with our enhancements: tests, CI, etc.).

### Optional progressive frontend initialization

> "Progressive" plugin - the one that will be generated by the Nx (a pluggable OeX Platform app that has an API for a comprehensive React-based frontend application).

There must be a way easily generate a "progressive" frontend application on the top of a "classic" OeX Platform plugin.

There must be a way to add more than one such progressive frontend.

### Plugin packaging

All monorepo's codebase must be able to be built into the single installable python package for the following distribution.

## Vision

"Progressive" monorepo includes the following parts:

- oex-plugin (python > django > DRF + ...)
- frontend-spa#1 (js > React + Redux + ...)
- frontend-spa#2 (js > React + Redux + ...)

### Open edX Platform plugin

Modifies or extends OeX Platform functionality.
It is installed to LMS or/and CMS as a dependency.
It exposes an API for its frontend application(s).
It uses built frontend application(s) as its "static".

### Frontend SPA

Modifies, substitutes or extends OeX Platform's pieces of UI.
It is built and put inside the OeX Platform plugin
